A repository is a central, structured storage place or a person that holds something in large quantities. In a general sense, it can be a physical location like a museum or a warehouse, or an abstract collection such as a repository of knowledge. In a technical context, such as software development, it is a centralized storage system for digital assets like software code, data, and configurations, often managed by systems like Git
